## Tools

### Visual Studio Code
This is an awesome and free IDE (Integrated Development Environment) - the application you use to write and build code.

https://code.visualstudio.com/

### HTML 5
For the structure of your page

### CSS 3
Making your structure look nice

### JS
Making your page functional

(Probably do this bit once you are comfortable with everything else)

### Bootstrap 4
 This is a front-end toolkit and is the industry standard for creating pretty websites that work from desktop to mobile

It is essentially a collection of html css and javascript components that you can use to build a website, rather than starting from scratch

### Source control
Git is how developers communicate with each other

It is the foundation of Github and worth understanding the basics so that you can save your code into the cloud, and collaborate

https://git-scm.com/

## Guide

In GitHub, fork this repository. This essentially copy pastes it into your own repo so you can make your own changes without affecting the original.

Open VS Code, and hit "clone repository" and then search for your new repo. Eg `JesseHolwell/somelessons`

Cloning a repository takes a copy of the code from the cloud and puts it on your machine, and remembers the cloud location for when you want to push changes back up into the cloud.

Select where on your harddrive you want your code to live. Eg `C:\Source\GitHub`

Then open the cloned repo and you should see the files in the explorer on the left

Now press `` ctrl + ` `` to open the terminal

You don't really have to use the terminal and can use explorer if you want, but terminal will be used a lot in the future

Some command line basics:

`dir` - list the contents of the current folder

`cd ..` - go up one level

`cd somelessons` - go down into the somelessons folder

`cd C:\Source\GitHub\somelessons` - navigate directly here

From the somelessons folder, go ahead and enter `start page.html`

It might ask you which browser to use, then the page should open up and you can see the website.

From here, make any changes within VSCode, and when you save the file and refresh the browser, the changes will appear.

You now have all the tools you need to create the front end of a website.

The possibilities are endless!
